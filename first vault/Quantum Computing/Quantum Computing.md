# What is quantum computing?
Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging(الظاهرة حديثا وبتطور سريع) technology that harnesses(استغل) the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers. 

Today, IBM Quantum makes real quantum hardware -- a tool scientists only began to imagine three decades ago -- available to hundreds of thousands of developers. Our engineers deliver ever-more-powerful(أقوى من أي وقت مضى) superconducting quantum processors ==at regular intervals==, alongside crucial advances in software and quantum-classical orchestration(عملية تنظيم ومزامنة وتناسق). This work drives toward the quantum computing speed and capacity necessary to change the world.

# Why do we need quantum computers?
For some problems, ==supercomputers aren’t that super==.

When scientists and engineers encounter difficult problems, they turn to supercomputers. These are very large classical computers, often with thousands of classical CPU and GPU cores. However, even supercomputers struggle to solve certain kinds of problems.

If a supercomputer gets stumped(يتعثر), that's probably because the big classical machine was asked to solve a problem with a high degree of complexity. When classical computers fail, it's often due to complexity. Complex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways. Modeling the behavior of individual atoms in a molecule is a complex problem, because of all the different electrons interacting with one another. Sorting out the ideal routes for a few hundred tankers in a global shipping network is complex too.

- ## properties of binomial heap
	- Every binomial tree in H satisfies the MIN heap property
		- the root of a heap-ordered tree contains the smallest key in the tree
	- There can be one or zero binomial trees for each order including zero order.
		- a binomial heap H having N nodes contains at most   **log (N + 1)**   binomial trees

	- ![[Pasted image 20221208103348.png]]
	- every node N has a degree field which stores the number of children of N
	- If N is the root node - - -> `P[N] = NULL.`
	- If N has no children - - -> `Child[N] = NULL,`
	- If N is the rightmost child of its parent - - -> `Sibling[N] = NIL.`
- ## 12.2.2 Operations
	- Creating that heap
		- O(1)
		- `Head[H]` is set to NULL
	- Finding the Node with Minimum Key

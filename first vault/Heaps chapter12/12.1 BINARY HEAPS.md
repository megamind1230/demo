- It’s a complete binary tree which satisfies that `If B is a child of A, then key(A) >= key(B)`
- ## 2 types

- ## properties
	- since its a complete binary tree ..
			- all elements are stored sequentially in arr
				- if an element is at position `i` in the array, then its `left child` is stored at position `2i` and its `right child` at position `2i+1`.
				- Conversely, an element at position `i` has its `parent` stored at position `i/2`
			- levels accept the last are filled completely
			-  $height= log_2(n) , where \ n \ is\ numberOfElements$
			- popular when implementing `the priority queue`
			- makes it easier for adding elements randomly then removing the
				- highest value elements , in case of MAX heap
				- the opposite with MIN heap

	- ### Complexity
	- average >> `O(1)`
	- worst case
		- single value insertion >> `O(log n)`
		- building an n-heap >> `O(n log n)`

- ## 12.1.3 Applications of binary heaps
	- #### heap sort
	- #### implementation of priority queue
- ## 12.1.4 Binary heap implementation of priority queue
	- priority queue may be implemented with the linked list
	- unlike the regular queue, 
	  While the higher priority elements are added at the front of the priority queue, 
	  elements with lower priority are added at the rear.
	- `sidie note: ` though we can easily implement priority queues using a linear array, but we should first
	   consider the time required to insert an element in the array and then sort it. We need `O(n)` 
	   time to insert an element and at least `O(n log n)` time to sort the array. 
	   Therefore, a better way to implement a priority queue is by using a binary heap which allows both enqueue and dequeue of elements in `O(log n)` time.

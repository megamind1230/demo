- ## the programming complexity of Fibonacci heaps makes them less desirable to use
- ### What is The Fibonacci Sequence 
	- ![[Pasted image 20221208154531.png]] 
- ## it
	- is a collection of trees
	- **is loosely (بشكل كبير) based on binomial heaps**
	- differs from binomial heaps as it has a more relaxed structure, allowing improved asymptotic time bounds.
	- is generally accessed by a pointer called `min[H]` which points to the root that has a MIN value
	- has a root list that is arbitrarily-ordered.
	- is simply a collection of unordered binomial trees
- ## If neither the decrease-value nor the delete operation is performed, each tree in the heap is like a binomial tree
- ## 12.3.1 Structure of Fibonacci Heaps
	- 
		```text
		Although a Fibonacci heap is a collection of heap-ordered trees, the trees in a 
		Fibonacci heap are not constrained to be binomial trees. 
		That is, while the trees in a binomial heap are ordered, those within Fibonacci heaps are rooted but unordered.

	- each node has
		- a pointer to its parent
		- a pointer to any one of its children.
	- children are in circular linked list
		- this allows
			- a node to be removed in `O(1)`
			- lists to be concatenated in `O(1)`
		- If node x is the only child of its parent, then `left= right= x`
- ## 12.3.2 Operations
	- ### no deleting
	- #### The underlying principle of operations on Fibonacci heaps is to delay the work as long as possible
	- ### [[12.3.2 intro]]
	- Creating a New Fibonacci Heap takes takes `O( 1 )`
	- Inserting a New Node

	- Finding the Node with Minimum Key takes `O( 1 )`
	- Uniting Two Fibonacci Heaps
